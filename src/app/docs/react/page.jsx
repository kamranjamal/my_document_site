        <p className="text-gray-300">
          React was created to solve the challenges of building complex and dynamic user interfaces. Facebook needed a solution that could manage rapidly changing data, improve performance, and simplify the development process. Reactâ€™s component-based architecture and efficient DOM handling with Virtual DOM addressed these issues, making UI development faster, modular, and easier to manage.
